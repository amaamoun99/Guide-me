# Guide-me
Guide-Me is a project that utilizes the graph data structure to build a map of cities connected by different modes of transportation with varying prices. Users can input their desired starting city, destination, and maximum budget. The system then displays available transportation options within the specified budget, along with the shortest and cheapest paths between the two cities.
